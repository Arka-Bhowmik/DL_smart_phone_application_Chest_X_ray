# Deep learning enabled application to classify digital Chest X-ray on smart-phone

This repository consist of python script for training deep convolutional neural network to classify COVID-19-related pneumonia from non-COVID-19 pneumonia and normal digital chest X-ray, and the detailed steps to deploy the trained model to an android device. This repository will help new developers to make their own android application that uses CNN models for standalone prediction. The needed packages for creating a custom changes in the program is detailed below. Our android app file accepts single 2D X-ray image and provides the probability of the certain class.


To install our app file in smartphone or tablet without any custom changes refer the installation steps in folder app_file. However, in case of introducing user based custom changes in executable files all necessary modification needed to be made in the provided android-studio and python scripts.


:disappointed: This repository is under construction. Not ready for use!
